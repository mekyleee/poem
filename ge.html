        <h2>GEISHA</h2>
        <p>
         I feel a shame for me to write this down,
         <br>
I was stranded, lost by my own thoughts, 
<br>
For ever since you've accepted me,
<br>
i can't get you out in this head of mine,
<br>
Trapped, chained and binded.
<br>
I have this feeling that's driven me.
<br>
that a life without you isn't complete but a misery. 
<br>
Things that i've said last night driving my head chaotically,
<br>
for it might find a reason for you to leave me. 
<br>
My affection for you have not change
<br>
and it never will.
<br>
I still see you as a person who blinded me,
<br>
the person that makes me to find no shines in anybody
<br>
for you shines so bright
<br>
that it's the only thing that i see
<br>
in which gives me a reason to find no shines in anybody
<br>
for your beautyness is the only thing that i see.
