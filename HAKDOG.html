        <h2>Short Story: Cycle of Endings</h2>
        <p>
           In a land beyond mountains, <br>
           there was an animal <br>
           who's born with everything <br>
           its gaze is as fierce as lighting, <br>
           its claws is as sharp as sword <br>
           a body that's made for hunting <br>
           He made no friends, and even left his family <br>
           thinking everyone around him wil be just a burden <br>
           For he think he's different. <br>
           It hunt and kills its prey, naive and bold with no pity in his eyes. <br>
           Sometimes it just kills its prey for the sake of fun. <br>
           its fierce is untoppable. <br>
           As years passed by, the animal became old but fierce as ever. <br>
           he's hungry so he hunts for food, as he saw his prey and run towards it <br>
           he wasn't be able to catch it. <br>
           it was the day, he realized that he become slow, fragile and weak. <br>
           for once a predator now a prey <br>
           once a hunter now become hunted <br>
           and that signifies its destruction. <br>
    
           "Even the strongest meets its destruction.

        <h2>Poem: Times</h2>
        Life is a fleeting moment 
        our very breath is borrowed 
        for one person shouldn't be too cruel. 
        Live meaningfully before the death comes.
