I feel a shame for me to write this down,
I was stranded, lost by my own thoughts, 
For ever since you've accepted me,
i can't get you out in this head of mine,
Trapped, chained and binded.
I have this feeling that's driven me
that a life without you isn't complete but a misery. 
Things that i've said last night driving my head chaotically,
for it might find a reason for you to leave me. 
My affection for you have not change
and it never will.
I still see you as a person who blinded me,
the person that makes me to find no shines in anybody
for you shines so bright
that it's the only thing that i see
in which gives me a reason to find no shines in anybody
for your beautfulyness is the only thing that i see.
