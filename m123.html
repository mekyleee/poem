 Every where i go you're there,
 Every time i seek a place, 
 you're there.
 I simply don't understand
 why i am i haunted by you
 when  all i did was loved you.
 Was i too much of too love?
 or im just an ignorance who knows
 nothing about love?
This past few days has been a torment
 i can't get out you in my head, 
 you're there everywhere i go, 
 like the weights of silence binding me still.
 I don't know, which road should i take,
 for it doesn't make any difference,
 the paths that's in my head,
 is always with you. 
 things that i wanted,
wanted to have it with you. 
probably this is my sin,
to me for fallin  for you.
